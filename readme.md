📈 Robust Alpha Generation Using LSTM Models
A Comprehensive Pipeline for Predictive Financial Analytics



🔍 Overview 
This project presents a robust alpha generation pipeline leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for stock price prediction. It integrates:

Advanced feature engineering using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
Hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner
Comprehensive risk analysis and metrics
A simulated trading strategy based on model predictions
The pipeline was tested on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock data from 2020 to 2023 and showcases effective predictive performance with real-world applications in financial markets.
